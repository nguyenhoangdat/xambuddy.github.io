In this tutorial, I will discuss about integrating Xamarin.Forms to Edubot. 

[Edubot Remote Github Repository](https://github.com/xambuddy/EdubotRemote).

If you're interested in IoT (Internet of Things), this is the article for you.

## What is Edubot?
It's a Mobile Robot created for Kto12 Learners

Basic programmable mobile robot for young (and not so young) learners. Graphical programming style is used to program the robot - programming is done by assembling together a set of blocks, very much like playing on a jigsaw puzzle.

## How to Start?
### 1. Download the Arduino IDE with the E-Gizmo Hardwares
[Download Arduino IDE] (https://www.e-gizmo.net/oc/kits%20documents/ARDUINO%20IDE%20SOFTWARES/arduino-1.8.10%20-windows%20.exe).

* A bulletted list
- alternative syntax 1
+ alternative syntax 2
  - an indented list item

1. An
2. ordered
3. list

Inline markup styles:

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()`

> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote

Syntax highlighting can be used with triple backticks, like so:

```javascript
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  

Finally, horizontal lines
